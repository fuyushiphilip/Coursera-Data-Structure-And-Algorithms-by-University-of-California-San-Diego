## Amortized Analysis

### Amotized Cost:

Given a sequence of n operations, amortized cost is:

```( Cost (n operations) / n )```

### Aggregate Method

### Banker's Method

- Charge extea for each cheap operation
- Save the extra charges as tokens in your data structure
- Use the tokens to pay expensive operations

### Physicist's Method

Define a potential function, **phi** which maps states of the data structure to integers:


- phi(h0) = 0
- phi(h[t]) >= 0

**Amortized cost** for operation t:
` c[t] + phi(h[t]) - phi(h[t - 1]) `

Choose phi so that:

- if c[t] is small, the potential increses
- if c[t] is large, the potential decreses by same scale

The cost of n operation is **sum(c[i])** from i=0 to n
