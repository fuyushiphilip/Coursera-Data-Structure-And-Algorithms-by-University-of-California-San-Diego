## Trees

### Defination

**A tree** is:

1. Empty, or
1. a node with:
 	- a key, and
	- a list of the child trees.
	- parents (optional)

### Terminology

1. **Root:** top node of the tree
2. **Child:** A line down directly from a parent
3. **Ansestors:** Parent, or parent of parent, etc.
4. **Descendant:** Child, or child of child, etc.
5. **Sibling:** Sharing the same parents.
6. **Leaf:** Node with no children
7. **Level:** 1 + number of edges between root and the node
8. **Height:** Maximim depth of the subtree node and the farthest leaf
9. **Forest:** Collection of the trees


### Binary Trees

The tree with maximun of the 2 childern is called binary tree.

For a binary tree, node consist:
1. key
2. left
3. right
4. parents (OPtional)



### Implenentations


#### Height(tree)

```

Height(tree) {

   if tree == nil:
   	return 0

   return 1 + max(Height(tree.left) + Height(tree.right))

}

```

#### Size(tree)

```
Size(tree) {

   if tree == nil:
	return 0

   return 1 + max(Size(tree.left) + Size(tree.right))

}

```


### Depth First Traversal

The first three algorithms are used as depth first stratergies.

In all three algorithms all the sub-tree are traversed first before exploring the other sibling.

#### In_Order_traversal(tree)

```
In_Order_traversal(tree) {

   if tree == nil:
   return

   In_Order_traversal(tree.left)

   /// Operations on element ///

   In_Order_traversal(tree.right)

}

```

#### Pre_order_traversal(tree)

```

Pre_order_traversal(tree) {

   if tree = nil:
   	return

   /// Operations on element ///

   Pre_order_traversal(tree.left)
   Pre_order_traversal(tree.right)

}

```

#### Post_order_traversal(tree)

```

Post_order_traversal(tree) {

   if tree = nil:
   	return

   Pre_order_traversal(tree.left)
   Pre_order_traversal(tree.right)

   /// Operations on element ///

}

```

### Breath First Travelsal

It is used to traverse the tree such that all nodes in the same level are traversed first.

#### Level_Order_traversal(tree)

```
Level_Order_traversal(tree) {

   if tree == nil:
   	return

   Queue q
   q.Enqueue(tree)

   while not q.Empty() :
   	current = q.Dequeue()

   /// Operations on element ///

   if current.left != nil:
	q.Enqueue(current.left)

   if current.right != nil:
   	q.Enqueue(current.right)

   q.dequeue(current)

}

```
