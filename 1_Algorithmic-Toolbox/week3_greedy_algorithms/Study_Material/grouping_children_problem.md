### Grouping Children Problem

Let's consider the following situation.

You've invited a lot of children to a celebration party, and you want to entertain them and also teach them something in the process. You are going to hire a few teachers and divide the children into groups and assign a teacher to each of the groups this teacher will work with this group through the whole party.

But you know that for a teacher to work with a group of children efficiently children of that group should be of relatively the same age.

- More specifically age of any two children in the same group should differ by at most one year.

- Also, you want to minimize the number of groups.

Because you want to hire fewer teachers, and spend the money on presents and other kinds of entertainment for the children.

- So, you need to divide children into the minimum possible number of groups. Such that the age of any two children in any group differs by at most one year.

#### Native Solution

- m = no. of groups.
- C = array contaning age of students

```

long long min_groups_native() {

	m = len(C[])

	for each partition into groups{

		C = G1 + G2 + ....+ G(k) // make different groups.

		good = true;

		for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {

			if (max(G[i]) - min(G[i]) > 1)
				good = false;

		}

  		if (good)
			m = min(m, k); // Optamizing no of groups.
	}

	return m;
}


```

**Time complaxity:** sigma(2^n)

#### Effective Solution

- Consider age of student as points in line.
- Condider the line segment of length 1 and keep courser at left most point.


```
long long min_groups_fast(C[n]) {

  	R = set([]);
  	i = 1;

  	while(i<=n) {

  	    l = C[i];
  	    r = c[i] + 1;

  	    [l, r] = [C[i], C[i] + 1]

  	    R += l, r;
  	    i += 1;

       // While i is less then n we didn't cover all points and we need to make sure that points doesn't goes beyond r.

  	    while(i<=n && C[i]<=r) {
  	        i+=1;
  	    }

  	}


  	return R;

  }

```

- If C[] is sorted.... **Time complexity:** O(n)

- If C[] is not sorted.... **Time complexity:** O(nlog(n))
