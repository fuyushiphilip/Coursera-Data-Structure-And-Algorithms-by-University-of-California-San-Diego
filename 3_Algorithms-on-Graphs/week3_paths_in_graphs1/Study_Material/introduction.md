#### Path and the Lenghts

**Length** of the path L(P) is the number of the edges in the path.

![Graph](images/paths_and_lengths.png)

L(D - E - S - A - B) = 4

#### Distance

The **distance** between two vertices is the length of the shortest path between them.

![distance](images/distance.png)

d(C, A) = 2
d(D, B) = 3

![Distance directed](images/distance_directed.png)

d(D, B) = 4
d(C, A) = inf


First we will study to find the distance of the given node from all the other node in the graph.

- This can be achive by converted the graph to the distance layer.

For the directed graph:

![Directed Graph Distance Layer](images/directed_graph_distance_layer.png)


The general property is that:

- There can't be any edge from a layer to another layer which is far from S by atleast two.
- There can be edge from one layer to another layer.
- There can be edge within the layer edges.
- There can be edge from a layer to any of the previous layers.

The distance from the top vertex to any other vertex is the layer number of that vertex.

This can be acchive by the **breadth first search**.
